# Ensuring Web Content Integrity using Hashing
# Introduction
Hashing converts input data (message) into a fixed-size string of bytes, typically representing a shorter, unique identifier of the original data. This process uses a hash function, which takes an input (message) and produces a fixed-size string of characters. The most widely used standard hash functions to ensure integrity and authenticity include MD5 (Message Digest 5) and the SHA(Secure Hashing Algorithm) family (SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3).
In this digital era, Web services are based on a client-server architecture. The client-server architecture refers to a system that hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services that the client requests.

# Objective
Maintaining the integrity of web content remains a critical challenge amidst evolving cybersecurity threats. We'd like to suggest a server-side approach to ensure the integrity of web content, addressing concerns arising from potential changes at the server. This approach leverages hash functions for content  integrity verification and geographically distributed servers to recover content in case of attack.
